```dart
String name = "Amit";
int age = 33;
double height = 1.75;

or 
var name1 = "Amit";
var age1 = 33;
var height = 1.75;

height1 = "bob";
//it fails.
```

dart can infer the types of these automatically, from the value that is 
being assigned to them.

reassignment of a different type does not works.
